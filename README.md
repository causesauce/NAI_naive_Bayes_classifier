Programming task 4

Naive Bayes

Implement naive Bayes classifier. Program should be general and should work on any correct data.

Run it on car-bayes data.

Use data from train file to classify all observations from test file. The last attribute is decision attribute. Calculate accuracy on test file.

User can enter a custom observation. Program should print calculated probabilities and

the answer for this observation.
